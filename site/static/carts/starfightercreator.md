# Starfighter Ship Creator

Create your starship to use in Starfighter Arena.  Use the mouse to place vertices on the grid.  Ships are horizontally symmetrical.

The left mouse button will perform the action selected on the right.  The right mouse button will delete the vertex under the mouse.  The middle mouse button will select the vertex under the mouse.

Use the generated security code to fly your starship in a multi-player battle in Starfighter Arena.
