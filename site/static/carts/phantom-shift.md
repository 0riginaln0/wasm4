# PHANTOM SHIFT

Turn your light on or off to phase into an alternate world. Find out the hard way what happens when you phase into a wall!

This is a 1-bit jam entry. [itch.io page](https://sergeypdev.itch.io/phantom-shift)
Note: this game uses only ever uses two colors at the same time, but palette is changing when you turn the light on or off.

I spent way too much time on the visuals, so only had time to make 3 levels and no sound, whoops.
Hope you like this prototype :)
