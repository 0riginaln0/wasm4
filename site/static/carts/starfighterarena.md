# Starfighter Arena

A multi-player only space battle.  Use the Starfighter Ship Creator to create your ship and use the generated security code to fight other players!

Use the direction pad to move/see scores.  Use the gamepad buttons to show/hide the radar and shoot.

Your ship is constantly generating a small amount of energy.  Moving, shooting, and getting hit will deplete your energy.  You can see your energy reserves at the bottom of the screen.  If your energy gets depleted and you are hit by an enemy, your ship will be destroyed.

There is currently no sound.
